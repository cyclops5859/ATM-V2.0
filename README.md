# ATM-V2.0
Previous ATM program was simple, but this second version is more advanced with 4 diffrent languages. Your ATM can now speak, this is done considering the disabled people and now the ATM system has a security feature where if you enter 911 or your pin reversed, it will display a message saying the local authorities have been informed.  There is also keycard feature, any detachable USB drive will act as your card is an actual ATM. Also your passcode to access the ATM is '5836'

Or just run the executable file (.exe) file, where you will not have to be worried about the codes and Python modules.

Chears lads!
